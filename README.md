# EW-1-Project
## Team members: Sasanka Uppuluri, Harshwardhan Prasad
This project was done as a part of the course Electronic workshop-1 in Monsoon 2019. The goal of this project is to recreate the popular 'Snake game' that used to be available in Nokia phones. We used arduino UNO as the microcontroller and the game is played on the 8x8 LED matrix.
